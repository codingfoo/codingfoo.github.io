I found that email was an attention killer.</p> <p>Here are the things that I did to use email effectively and avoid losing focus.</p> <h2 id=disable-email-alerts>Disable email alerts</h2> <p>I turned off all alerts for email. My phone does not even connect to my email account. Be deliberate about when you check your email.</p> <p>We forget that email is an asynchrounous tool.</p> <h2 id=schedule-times-to-check-your-email>Schedule times to check your email</h2> <p>I check my email only at specific times of the day. The two best times I have found are around noon and 4. The exact time is flexible because I don't want to interrupt something I am working on to check my email. Once I have finished what I am working on then I will check email.</p> <p>Do not check email while waiting for something to complete. It will distract you from your work.</p> <p>Only check it when you will have the time to process your email.</p> <h2 id=follow-inbox-to-zero>Follow inbox to zero</h2> <p>The process of inbox to zero is best explained elsewhere: https://zenhabits.net/inbox-master-get-all-your-inboxes-to-zero-and-have-fewer-inboxes/</p> <h2 id=archive-and-search>Archive and search</h2> <p>Research has found that it is faster to just archive and search than it is to sort emails into folders and look for an email.</p> <p>I make two exceptions to the no folders rule. I have a receipts and a waiting folder. I put receipts into a folder because I often need to look at a date range of the receipts.</p> <p>The waiting folder is for any emails for which I am waiting for a reply.</p> <h2 id=use-send-it-later-tools>Use send it later tools</h2> <p>Use tools to send emails at a later time, especially if you check your emails after normal work hours, this way people wont think you are always checking your email. Use http://boomerangapp.com/ if you use gmail.</p> <p>Use the "Send it later" plugin for thunderbird.</p> <h2 id=compose-emails-when-needed-without-looking-at-your-inbox>Compose emails when needed without looking at your inbox</h2> <p>I sometimes need to write emails during the day, however I dont want view my inbox. You can open a compose window to write an email to avoid being distracted by your inbox.</p> <p>Gmail: http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/45763194525/compose-gmail-message</p> <p>Thunderbird on Mac: <code>/Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird-bin -compose</code></p> <h2 id=dont-use-your-email-as-a-task-list>Dont use your email as a task list</h2> <p>If you use email as your task list then you can be distracted by your inbox when you look at your task emails.</p> <p>Make a task list elsewhere.</p> <footer role=contentinfo> <a href='/copyright/'><p class=license>Copyright &copy; Bowen Masco</p></a> </footer> </body> </html>
